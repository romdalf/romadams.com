# Call for Papers: Unifying the European Sovereign Cloud: An Open Source Interoperability Hub

## Dev Room Focus
The European vision for Sovereign Cloud faces a critical challenge: fragmentation. EU member states, institutions, and agencies must navigate a complex ecosystem of multiple in-country cloud providers/hosters, each operating with distinct APIs, disparate procurement workflows, and varied resource definitions. This operational complexity hinders cross-border collaboration and makes compliance with new EU digital legislation (like the NIS2, DORA, and upcoming Data/Cyber Resilience Acts) overly burdensome.  

This Dev Room aims to launch a practical, open-source project that will create a Unified Interface—an API Gateway—to simplify the interaction between EU bodies and national cloud providers. This platform will enable bi-directional onboarding, procurement, and management of cloud resources across the continent, ensuring all operations align with the specific regulatory demands of the EU.

## What We Are Looking For
We are seeking submissions for presentations (15-20 minutes), lightning talks (5-10 minutes), and interactive workshops (30-45 minutes) that contribute to the design, governance, and development of this unified sovereign cloud interface.

Ideal submissions will focus on:

1. Technical Design and Implementation  

* Proposals for the Unified API Specification (e.g., based on OpenAPI/Swagger) that can abstract diverse cloud APIs (IaaS/PaaS).
* Case studies or proposals on Cloud Brokerage and Interoperability platforms.
* Security and identity management models (e.g., using EU eIDAS) for a cross-provider, multi-tenant gateway.
* Open-source tools or projects that could serve as the core building blocks (e.g., CNCF projects, standards bodies).

2. Procurement and Compliance  

* Experiences or models for standardizing Cloud Procurement processes across different national public sector entities.
* Strategies for ensuring the Unified Interface explicitly addresses the requirements of EU Digital Acts (e.g., data residency, exit strategies, security controls).
* Presentations on Data Sovereignty requirements and technical approaches to enforcing them (e.g., encryption, geo-fencing).

3. Governance and Community  

* Models for open-source governance that can sustain a project involving multiple EU institutions, national agencies, and private cloud providers.
* Discussions on licensing strategies suitable for public-sector technology.
* Use cases and requirements from EU bodies or member state agencies regarding cloud management challenges.
